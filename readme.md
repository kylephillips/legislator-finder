## Legislator Finder

This is a simple website that combines data from Google's Civic Information API and Open State's API into a tool for looking up legislators based on a U.S. address. The geocoding and mapping is built using the Google Maps Javascript API, with the geocoding and places libraries enabled.

The site is built in the Laravel PHP framework.
